# Permission Options Comparison

Choose the permission level that fits your needs and organization's security policy.

## 🎯 Three Permission Approaches

### Option 1: Minimal (Most Restrictive) ❌
**For:** Highly regulated environments, very cautious admins

**Permissions:**
- ✅ ECR (push images)
- ✅ ECS (deploy only, no scaling)
- ✅ CloudWatch (view logs - read only)
- ✅ S3 (specific bucket only)

**What You Can Do:**
- Deploy solver updates
- View logs
- Basic troubleshooting

**What You Can't Do:**
- Scale resources
- Create buckets
- Configure load balancers
- Deploy frontend
- Set up domain
- Create IAM roles

**Result:**
- ❌ Need admin for most tasks
- ❌ Slow iteration cycles
- ❌ Limited troubleshooting
- ✅ Very controlled access

**Documentation:** See `REQUIRED_IAM_PERMISSIONS.md` → Minimum section

---

### Option 2: Standard Developer (Recommended) ⭐
**For:** Normal development teams, professional environments

**Permissions:**
- ✅ ECR (full)
- ✅ ECS (full)
- ✅ S3 (full)
- ✅ CloudWatch (full)
- ✅ IAM (service roles only)
- ✅ ELB (full)
- ✅ Amplify (full)
- ✅ Route 53 (full)
- ✅ ACM (full)

**What You Can Do:**
- Deploy everything independently
- Scale resources
- Configure load balancers
- Deploy frontend
- Set up custom domain
- Create service roles
- Full troubleshooting
- Update configurations
- Roll back deployments

**What You Can't Do:**
- Create IAM users
- Access billing
- Modify account settings
- Access other teams' resources

**Result:**
- ✅ Work independently
- ✅ Fast iterations
- ✅ Professional autonomy
- ✅ Proper developer experience

**Documentation:** See `PERMANENT_DEVELOPER_PERMISSIONS.md` ⭐

---

### Option 3: Full Administrator (Not Recommended)
**For:** Small teams, personal AWS accounts, testing

**Permissions:**
- ✅ Everything (AdministratorAccess policy)

**What You Can Do:**
- Literally everything in AWS
- Create IAM users
- Modify billing
- Account-level changes

**What You Can't Do:**
- Nothing (full access)

**Result:**
- ✅ No restrictions
- ❌ Security risk
- ❌ Overkill for this project
- ❌ Not recommended for production

## 💰 Request Frequency

### With Minimal Permissions:
```
Deploy solver → Request permission
Need to scale → Request permission
Create bucket → Request permission
Configure LB → Request permission
Deploy frontend → Request permission
Update domain → Request permission
Fix issue → Request permission (maybe)
```
**Result:** 5-10+ admin requests per deployment cycle 😫

### With Standard Developer Permissions:
```
Deploy solver → Do it yourself
Need to scale → Do it yourself
Create bucket → Do it yourself
Configure LB → Do it yourself
Deploy frontend → Do it yourself
Update domain → Do it yourself
Fix issue → Do it yourself
```
**Result:** 0 admin requests for normal work 🎉

### With Full Admin:
```
Everything → Do it yourself
Create IAM users → Do it yourself (but shouldn't)
Modify billing → Do it yourself (but shouldn't)
```
**Result:** Too much power, security risk ⚠️

## 🎯 Recommendation by Organization Type

### Startup / Small Team (5-20 people)
**Recommended:** Standard Developer ⭐ or Full Admin
- Fast moving, need autonomy
- Everyone trusted
- Cost control via billing alerts

### Mid-size Company (20-100 people)
**Recommended:** Standard Developer ⭐
- Balance security and autonomy
- Proper DevOps practices
- Clear resource ownership

### Enterprise (100+ people)
**Recommended:** Standard Developer ⭐ with additional controls
- Change management process
- Separate dev/staging/prod accounts
- Required approvals for prod
- But still self-service in dev/staging

### Highly Regulated (Finance, Healthcare, Government)
**Recommended:** Minimal + approval process
- Strict change control
- All changes logged and audited
- Separation of duties
- Accept slower iteration

## 📧 Which Email Template to Use

### For Standard Developer (Recommended):
→ Use `PERMANENT_DEVELOPER_PERMISSIONS.md` email template

**When to use:**

## 🎓 Real-World Examples

### Minimal Permissions Scenario:
```
Monday 9am: Want to deploy update
Monday 9:15am: Email admin for ECR push permission
Monday 2pm: Admin grants permission
Monday 2:30pm: Push image
Monday 2:45pm: Email admin for ECS deploy permission
Tuesday 10am: Admin grants permission
Tuesday 10:30am: Deploy
Tuesday 11am: Notice need to scale
Tuesday 11:15am: Email admin for scaling permission
Tuesday 4pm: Admin grants permission
Tuesday 4:30pm: Finally scaled

Result: 2 days for one deployment 😫
```

### Standard Developer Scenario:
```
Monday 9am: Want to deploy update
Monday 9:15am: Push image to ECR
Monday 9:30am: Update ECS service
Monday 9:45am: Deployed and tested
Monday 10am: Notice need to scale
Monday 10:05am: Scale up ECS service
Monday 10:10am: Verified scaling

Result: 1 hour for deployment + scaling 🎉
```

## 🛡️ Security Comparison

### Minimal Permissions:
**Security:** High (very restrictive)
**Risk:** Low
**Productivity:** Low

### Standard Developer:
**Security:** Good (appropriate boundaries)
**Risk:** Low-Medium (manageable with safeguards)
**Productivity:** High

### Full Admin:
**Security:** Low (no boundaries)
**Risk:** High
**Productivity:** High (but risky)

**Winner:** Standard Developer (best balance) ⭐

## 💡 Key Insight

**The goal is NOT minimal permissions.**
**The goal is APPROPRIATE permissions for your role.**

A developer should have:
- ✅ Full control over their application's resources
- ❌ No access to other applications
- ❌ No access to account-level settings
- ❌ No ability to create users

This is **Standard Developer** permissions.
