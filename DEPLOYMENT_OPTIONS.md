# Deployment Architecture Guide

## Current Issue
Right now, every user needs to run the FastAPI solver locally, which is not practical for production.

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. üè¢ **Enterprise/Hospital Deployment**
**Best for: Hospitals with IT infrastructure**

```bash
# On hospital server
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 scheduling-solver
# Web app points to: http://hospital-server:8000
```

**Benefits:**
- [Done] Full control over data
- [Done] No internet dependency for sensitive data
- [Done] Maximum performance
- [Done] Compliance-friendly (HIPAA, etc.)

### 2. ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud-Hosted Solver Service**
**Best for: Multi-tenant SaaS**

#### Option A: Self-hosted on VPS/Cloud
```bash
# Deploy to DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS EC2, etc.
# Cost: $20-100/month depending on usage
```

#### Option B: Containerized Deployment
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  solver:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=10
      - AUTH_REQUIRED=true
```

### 3. üîÑ **Hybrid: Local + Cloud Fallback**
**Best for: Development + Production flexibility**

The app automatically detects:
1. Try local solver first (http://localhost:8000)
2. Fallback to cloud solver if local not available
3. Graceful degradation with progress updates

### 4. üì± **Serverless with Extended Timeouts**
**Best for: Occasional use, cost-effective**

- **Vercel Functions**: 60-second limit (too short)
- **AWS Lambda**: 15-minute limit (good for medium cases)  
- **Google Cloud Run**: 60-minute limit (best option)
- **Railway/Render**: No timeout limits (simple deployment)

## Implementation Strategy

Let me implement **Option 3 (Hybrid)** which gives you maximum flexibility:

### For Users:
- Just visit your Vercel URL
- No local installation needed
- Works from any device/browser

### For You (Admin):
- Can run local solver for development
- Deploy cloud solver for production
- Users automatically use the best available option

Would you like me to implement this hybrid approach?
