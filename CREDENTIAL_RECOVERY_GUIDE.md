# [Secure] Credential Recovery System Documentation

## Overview

I have implemented a comprehensive and secure credential recovery system for your Medical Staff Scheduling System. This system allows users to recover their forgotten credentials by sending them securely to a pre-configured backup email address.

## [Secure] Security Features

### 1. **Backup Email Verification**
- Credentials are ONLY sent to the registered backup email address
- No credentials are sent without a properly configured backup email
- Email addresses are masked in the UI for privacy (e.g., `ad***n@example.com`)

### 2. **Rate Limiting Protection**
- Progressive lockout system prevents brute force attacks
- Failed recovery attempts are tracked and rate limited
- Same security system that protects login attempts

### 3. **Security Tokens & Audit Trail**
- Each recovery request generates a unique token for tracking
- All recovery attempts are logged with timestamps and IP addresses
- Recovery emails include security alerts and warnings

### 4. **Secure Email Content**
- Recovery emails include clear security warnings
- Timestamps and recovery tokens for audit purposes
- Instructions to contact administrator if recovery was not requested

## ðŸ“§ How It Works

### For Users:
1. **Setup** (One-time): Configure backup email in Settings
2. **Recovery**: On login page, click "Forgot your credentials?"
3. **Email**: Receive credentials at registered backup email
4. **Login**: Use received credentials to access the system

### For Administrators:
1. **Configuration**: Backup emails are stored securely with credentials
2. **Monitoring**: All recovery attempts are logged in console
3. **Security**: Rate limiting prevents abuse of recovery system

## [Maintenance] Implementation Details

### Files Modified/Created:

1. **`src/lib/credentialsManager.ts`**
   - Added backup email support to credential storage
   - Added functions: `getBackupEmail()`, `isBackupEmailConfigured()`, `generateRecoveryToken()`

2. **`src/lib/emailService.ts`**
   - Added `sendCredentialRecoveryEmail()` function
   - Security-focused email template with warnings
   - Development-friendly email preview system

3. **`src/app/api/auth/recover-credentials/route.ts`** (NEW)
   - Secure API endpoint for credential recovery
   - Rate limiting integration
   - Email masking for privacy
   - Comprehensive security logging

4. **`src/app/login/page.tsx`**
   - Added "Forgot your credentials?" link
   - Recovery request UI with confirmation
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Automatic availability checking

5. **`src/app/api/settings/update-credentials/route.ts`**
   - Updated to store backup email when credentials are changed

## [Goal] Usage Instructions

### Setting up Backup Email:
1. Login to the system
2. Go to Settings
3. Update your credentials and provide a backup email
4. The backup email is now configured for recovery

### Using Credential Recovery:
1. On the login page, you'll see "Forgot your credentials?" if recovery is available
2. Click the link to see recovery options
3. You'll see the masked backup email address
4. Click "Send Recovery Email" to receive your credentials
5. Check your email for the recovery message
6. Use the credentials from the email to login

### Security Notes:
- Recovery is only available if a backup email is configured
- The system will lock you out if you make too many recovery attempts
- Recovery emails include security warnings and audit information
- If you receive a recovery email you didn't request, contact your administrator

## [Maintenance] Development vs Production

### Development Mode:
- Uses Ethereal Email (test SMTP service)
- Emails are not sent to real addresses
- Console shows preview URLs to view emails
- All recovery attempts are logged to console

### Production Mode:
- Configure real email service (SendGrid, Gmail, etc.)
- Update environment variables for email credentials
- Emails are sent to actual backup addresses
- Consider additional monitoring and logging

## [Note] API Endpoints

### `GET /api/auth/recover-credentials`
- Check if recovery is available
- Returns masked backup email if configured
- Respects rate limiting

### `POST /api/auth/recover-credentials`
- Send recovery email to backup address
- Requires `confirmRecovery: true` in request body
- Returns success message with masked email

## [Done] Testing the System

1. **Setup**: Configure backup email in Settings
2. **Test Recovery**: Use "Forgot credentials" on login page
3. **Check Console**: Look for email preview URL in development
4. **Verify Email**: Check that email contains correct credentials
5. **Test Security**: Try multiple recovery attempts to test rate limiting

## ðŸš¨ Security Recommendations

1. **Email Service**: Use a professional email service in production
2. **Rate Limiting**: Monitor recovery attempt patterns
3. **Backup Email**: Encourage users to use secure email providers
4. **Audit Trail**: Regularly review recovery logs
5. **Updates**: Remind users to keep backup email addresses current

## [Feature] System Status: [Done] FULLY IMPLEMENTED

The credential recovery system is now completely implemented and ready for use. All security features are in place, the UI is integrated, and the system follows best practices for credential recovery.

**Next Steps:**
1. Test the system in your development environment
2. Configure production email service when ready
3. Train users on how to set up and use recovery
4. Monitor recovery usage and security logs
