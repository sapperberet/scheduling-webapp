# [Secure] Credential Recovery - Updated Implementation

## [Done] **Key Change: Smart Recovery Option Display**

The "Forgot your credentials?" option now appears **ONLY after the first failed login attempt**, making it contextually relevant when users actually need help.

## [Goal] **How It Works Now:**

### **Before Failed Attempt:**
- Login page shows only username/password fields
- No recovery option visible (clean, simple interface)
- User attempts to login normally

### **After Failed Attempt:**
 - [Error] "Invalid credentials" error appears
 - [Key] "Forgot your credentials?" link appears (if backup email configured)
- ðŸ“§ User can click to send recovery email to backup address
- OR: "Contact administrator" message (if no backup email)

### **User Experience:**
1. **First try**: User enters wrong credentials â†’ gets error
2. **Recovery appears**: "Forgot your credentials?" link shows up
3. **Help when needed**: Recovery option only when relevant
4. **Fresh start**: Typing new password clears error and hides recovery

## [Secure] **Security Features:**

 - [Done] **Rate limiting**: Recovery attempts are tracked and limited
 - [Done] **Backup email only**: Credentials sent only to pre-registered email
 - [Done] **Progressive lockout**: Same security system as login attempts
 - [Done] **Contextual display**: Recovery only shown when actually needed
 - [Done] **Fresh start**: Recovery state resets when user starts typing again

## ðŸ“± **UI Behavior:**

- **Clean initial state**: No recovery clutter on first visit
- **Smart appearance**: Recovery shows after first failed attempt
- **Auto-hide**: Recovery disappears when user starts typing again
- **Professional messaging**: Clear security warnings in recovery emails

## [Feature] **Result:**

Users now get a **clean login experience** that smartly offers help exactly when they need it - after they've tried and failed to login. This is more intuitive and professional than showing recovery options immediately.

**Perfect for**: Medical staff who occasionally forget credentials but don't need recovery options cluttering the interface when they remember their login details.
