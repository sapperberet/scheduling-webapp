# Vercel Environment Variables Setup

## Overview

The authentication system has been updated to work with Vercel's serverless environment. Credentials are now managed through environment variables instead of file-based storage.

## Required Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

### Authentication Credentials
- `ADMIN_USERNAME`: The admin login email (e.g., `admin@scheduling.com`)
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: The admin login password (use a strong password)
- `ADMIN_BACKUP_EMAIL`: Optional backup email for credential recovery
- `CREDENTIALS_UPDATED_AT`: ISO timestamp of when credentials were last updated

### NextAuth Configuration
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Secret key for NextAuth (generate a secure random string)
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Your production URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)

## Setting Environment Variables in Vercel

### Method 1: Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your project in the Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add each variable with the appropriate values
4. Make sure to set them for Production, Preview, and Development environments

### Method 2: Vercel CLI
```bash
# Set production environment variables
vercel env add ADMIN_USERNAME production
vercel env add ADMIN_PASSWORD production
vercel env add ADMIN_BACKUP_EMAIL production
vercel env add CREDENTIALS_UPDATED_AT production
vercel env add NEXTAUTH_SECRET production
vercel env add NEXTAUTH_URL production
```

## Example Values

```bash
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin@yourcompany.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword123!
ADMIN_BACKUP_EMAIL=backup@yourcompany.com
CREDENTIALS_UPDATED_AT=2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Strong Passwords**: Use a strong, unique password for the admin account
2. **Secure Secret**: Generate a strong random string for NEXTAUTH_SECRET (at least 32 characters)
3. **Backup Email**: Set up a backup email for credential recovery
4. **Regular Updates**: Update credentials periodically and update the CREDENTIALS_UPDATED_AT timestamp

## Local Development

For local development, you can either:

1. **Use .env.local file** (recommended):
   ```
   ADMIN_USERNAME=admin@scheduling.com
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
   ADMIN_BACKUP_EMAIL=your-backup@email.com
   CREDENTIALS_UPDATED_AT=2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-development-secret
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Use file-based storage**: The system will automatically fall back to the `.credentials.json` file if environment variables are not set in development.

## Generating Secrets

### NEXTAUTH_SECRET
```bash
# Generate a secure random string
openssl rand -base64 32
# or
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Environment variables not loading**: Redeploy after setting environment variables
2. **Authentication failing**: Check that ADMIN_USERNAME and ADMIN_PASSWORD are set correctly
3. **Credential recovery not working**: Ensure ADMIN_BACKUP_EMAIL is set and valid

### Debug Information
The system logs detailed information about the environment and credential loading:
- Check Vercel function logs for authentication attempts
- Look for "Loading credentials from environment variables" messages
- Verify environment detection with "Running in serverless environment" logs

## Migration from File-Based System

If you were previously using the file-based credential system:

1. Check your current `.credentials.json` file for the username, password, and backup email
2. Set these values as environment variables in Vercel
3. Set CREDENTIALS_UPDATED_AT to the current timestamp
4. Deploy the updated code
5. Test authentication in production

## Security Notes

- Never commit actual credential values to your repository
- Use strong, unique passwords for production
- Regularly rotate your NEXTAUTH_SECRET and admin credentials
- Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity
- Consider implementing additional security measures like IP whitelisting if needed
