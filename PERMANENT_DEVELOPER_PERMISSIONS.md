# Permanent IAM Permissions - Developer Autonomy

## üéØ Goal: Self-Service Deployment Without Constant Admin Requests

This permission set gives you everything needed to deploy and manage the application independently, without requesting permission for routine tasks.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended: Full Developer Permissions

Ask your admin to attach these policies **permanently** to your IAM user. These are standard for developers deploying production applications.

### Option 1: AWS Managed Policies (Simplest)

```
‚úÖ AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess
‚úÖ AmazonECS_FullAccess
‚úÖ AmazonS3FullAccess
‚úÖ CloudWatchLogsFullAccess
‚úÖ IAMFullAccess
‚úÖ ElasticLoadBalancingFullAccess
‚úÖ AmazonEC2FullAccess (or AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess minimum)
‚úÖ AdministratorAccess-Amplify
‚úÖ AmazonRoute53FullAccess
‚úÖ AWSCertificateManagerFullAccess
‚úÖ AmazonAPIGatewayAdministrator (if using Lambda)
‚úÖ AWSLambda_FullAccess (if using Lambda)
```

**Why these permissions:**
- You can deploy, update, scale, and troubleshoot independently
- You can manage your own resources
- You won't need to ask admin for routine tasks
- Standard for production developer roles

---

## üîí Alternative: Custom Policy with Full Control (More Secure)

If your admin prefers a custom policy instead of managed policies, use this:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "FullContainerManagement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ecr:*",
        "ecs:*",
        "ec2:*",
        "elasticloadbalancing:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "FullStorageManagement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::scheduling-*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::scheduling-*/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "FullLoggingAndMonitoring",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:*",
        "cloudwatch:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "FullIAMForServiceRoles",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iam::*:role/*TaskRole*",
        "arn:aws:iam::*:role/*ExecutionRole*",
        "arn:aws:iam::*:role/amplify-*",
        "arn:aws:iam::*:user/${aws:username}",
        "arn:aws:iam::*:policy/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "FullAmplifyManagement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "amplify:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "FullDNSManagement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "route53:*",
        "acm:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "LambdaManagement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "lambda:*",
        "apigateway:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "ReadAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "sts:GetCallerIdentity",
        "pricing:GetProducts",
        "support:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Full control over your project resources
- Can create, update, delete, troubleshoot
- No waiting for admin approval for changes
- Standard developer autonomy

## üéØ What You Can Do With These Permissions

### ‚úÖ YES - You Can Do Independently:

1. **Deploy solver** (ECS or Lambda)
2. **Update solver code**
3. **Scale resources** up or down
4. **Deploy frontend** (Amplify)
5. **Configure custom domain**
6. **Create S3 buckets** for results
7. **View and analyze logs**
8. **Set up monitoring** and alarms
9. **Create service roles** for ECS/Lambda
10. **Manage SSL certificates**
11. **Configure load balancers**
12. **Troubleshoot issues** via CloudWatch
13. **Update environment variables**
14. **Roll back deployments**
15. **Delete test resources**

### ‚ùå NO - You Still Can't Do (Admin Only):

1. **Create new IAM users** (security)
2. **Modify billing** settings
3. **Access other teams' resources**
4. **Change account-level settings**
5. **Create VPCs** (unless EC2FullAccess granted)
6. **Manage organization** policies

**This is normal and good!** These restrictions protect the overall AWS account.

## üìß Email Template for Permanent Permissions

```
Subject: Permanent Developer Permissions Request

Hi [Admin Name],

I'm deploying and maintaining our scheduling application on AWS. To work efficiently without constant permission requests, I need full developer permissions for my project resources.

Please attach these AWS managed policies to my IAM user PERMANENTLY:

‚úÖ AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess
‚úÖ AmazonECS_FullAccess  
‚úÖ AmazonS3FullAccess
‚úÖ CloudWatchLogsFullAccess
‚úÖ IAMFullAccess
‚úÖ ElasticLoadBalancingFullAccess
‚úÖ AmazonEC2FullAccess (or ReadOnly minimum)
‚úÖ AdministratorAccess-Amplify
‚úÖ AmazonRoute53FullAccess
‚úÖ AWSCertificateManagerFullAccess

These are standard permissions for developers managing production applications.

Benefits:
- I can deploy and update independently
- Faster development iterations
- No bottleneck waiting for permissions
- I can troubleshoot issues in real-time

Cost control:
- I'll set up billing alerts
- CloudWatch alarms for usage
- Regular cost reviews

Security:
- I cannot create IAM users
- I cannot access other projects
- All actions logged in CloudTrail
- MFA enabled on my account

Alternative: If you prefer, see the custom policy in PERMANENT_DEVELOPER_PERMISSIONS.md

My IAM username: [your-username]
Project: Scheduling Application
Expected monthly cost: $20-100

Thanks!
[Your Name]
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Safeguards to Mention

When requesting these permissions, assure your admin:

### 1. **Cost Controls**
```powershell
# Set up billing alarm
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name MonthlyBudget \
  --alarm-description "Alert at $100/month" \
  --metric-name EstimatedCharges \
  --threshold 100
```

### 2. **Tagging Resources**
Tag everything you create:
```
Project: SchedulingApp
Owner: YourName
Environment: Production
```

### 3. **CloudTrail Logging**
All your actions are logged automatically.

### 4. **MFA Enabled**
Enable multi-factor authentication on your IAM user.

### 5. **Access Key Rotation**
Rotate access keys every 90 days.

---

## üéì Why These Permissions Are Standard

### Industry Standard Developer Permissions

**Most tech companies give developers:**
- Full control over their application's resources
- Ability to deploy without approval
- Access to logs and monitoring
- Permission to scale and troubleshoot

**This is normal because:**
- Faster development cycles
- Developer accountability
- Reduced bottlenecks
- Real-world production experience

### Comparison with Other Roles

| Role | Permissions Level | Can Deploy? | Can Scale? | Can Delete? |
|------|------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Read-Only User** | View only | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| **Limited Developer** | Deploy only | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| **Full Developer** ‚≠ê | Full project control | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **Administrator** | Account-wide | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

You're requesting **Full Developer** permissions - standard for your role.

## üí° If Admin Is Hesitant

### Common Concerns & Responses

**Concern 1: "Too many permissions"**
Response: These are standard AWS managed policies used by thousands of companies. They're scoped to specific services, not account-wide admin access.

**Concern 2: "What about costs?"**
Response: I'll set up:
- Billing alarms ($50, $100 thresholds)
- Auto-scaling limits
- Regular cost reviews
- Resource tagging for tracking

**Concern 3: "What if you delete something important?"**
Response:
- S3 versioning enabled (can restore)
- ECS/Amplify: Git-based (can redeploy)
- CloudTrail logs all actions
- I'll follow change management process

**Concern 4: "Security risk?"**
Response:
- MFA enabled on my account
- Access keys rotated every 90 days
- All actions audited in CloudTrail
- Cannot create IAM users or access billing
- Only affects my project resources

**Concern 5: "Need approval for production changes"**
Response: We can implement:
- Separate dev/staging/prod environments
- Required for prod access
- Change request process for prod
- But need full access in dev/staging

## üîÑ Graduated Permission Model (Alternative)

If full permissions are not approved, suggest graduated approach:

### Phase 1: Deployment Only (Week 1)
```
- ECR (push images)
- ECS (deploy tasks)
- CloudWatch (view logs - read only)
```

### Phase 2: Add Management (Week 2)
```
+ ECS (scale, update)
+ S3 (create buckets)
+ CloudWatch (create alarms)
```

### Phase 3: Full Developer (Week 3+)
```
+ IAM (create roles)
+ ELB (configure load balancer)
+ Amplify (deploy frontend)
+ Route 53 (custom domain)
```

**After proving responsibility**, request permanent full access.

---

## üìä Permission Comparison

### Current (Requesting Permission Each Time)
```
‚ùå Slow: Wait hours/days for approval
‚ùå Inefficient: Multiple back-and-forth
‚ùå Frustrating: Can't troubleshoot issues
‚ùå Expensive: Admin time spent on approvals
```

### Proposed (Full Developer Permissions)
```
‚úÖ Fast: Deploy immediately
‚úÖ Efficient: Iterate quickly
‚úÖ Empowering: Fix issues in real-time
‚úÖ Cost-effective: No admin bottleneck
```

---

## üéØ Minimum Viable Permissions (If Admin Refuses Full Access)

If your admin absolutely won't grant full permissions, request this minimum:

```
‚úÖ AmazonECS_FullAccess (deploy)
‚úÖ AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess (images)
‚úÖ AmazonS3FullAccess (storage)
‚úÖ CloudWatchLogsFullAccess (logs)

Plus specific actions:
‚úÖ iam:CreateRole (create ECS task role)
‚úÖ iam:AttachRolePolicy (attach policies to role)
‚úÖ iam:PassRole (pass role to ECS)
```

**Limitation**: You'll still need admin for:
- Load balancer changes
- Frontend deployment
- Domain configuration
- Scaling policies

**But** you can at least deploy and update the solver independently.

---

## ‚úÖ Testing Your Permissions

After receiving permissions, verify:

```powershell
# 1. Can deploy
aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://test-task.json

# 2. Can scale
aws ecs update-service --cluster test --service test --desired-count 2

# 3. Can view logs
aws logs describe-log-groups

# 4. Can create S3 bucket
aws s3 mb s3://test-bucket-yourname

# 5. Can create IAM role
aws iam create-role --role-name test-role --assume-role-policy-document file://policy.json

# Clean up tests
aws s3 rb s3://test-bucket-yourname
aws iam delete-role --role-name test-role
```

All should succeed without "Access Denied".
