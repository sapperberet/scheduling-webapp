# 🔧 Authentication Configuration Fixed

## ✅ What I Fixed

1. **Environment Variable Mapping**: Updated the code to recognize your existing variables:
   - `ADMIN_EMAIL` → used for username
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` → used for password (with bcrypt support)
   - `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` → used as backup email fallback

2. **Password Hashing Support**: Added bcrypt support to handle your hashed passwords correctly

## 🔑 Your Login Credentials

Based on your environment variables and the test file, your credentials should be:

**Username**: The value in your `ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable
**Password**: `admin123` (if you're using the default hash from the test file)

## 🧪 Test Your Current Setup

The hash `$2a$12$LQv3c1yqBWVHxkd0LHAkCOYz6TtxMQJqhN8/LewviUK1CXLaWhWH2` corresponds to the password `admin123`.

If this is your `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` value, then use:
- **Username**: Whatever email you set in `ADMIN_EMAIL`
- **Password**: `admin123`

## 🔍 Debug Information

After the fix, you should see logs like:
```
🔍 Credential validation (bcrypt): {
  environment: 'serverless',
  providedUsername: 'your-email@domain.com',
  usedBcrypt: true,
  isValid: true
}
```

Instead of the previous failed validation.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Try logging in** with:
   - Username: The email address you set in `ADMIN_EMAIL`
   - Password: `admin123` (if using the default hash)

2. **Check the logs** in Vercel Functions to see the detailed validation info

3. **If you need to find your exact username**: Check your Vercel environment variables dashboard for the `ADMIN_EMAIL` value

## 🔧 If You Need to Update Credentials

To update your login credentials:

```bash
# Update the email/username
vercel env add ADMIN_EMAIL production
# Enter your desired email

# Update the password hash (generate new hash first)
vercel env add ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH production
# Enter the bcrypt hash of your new password

vercel --prod  # Redeploy
```

## 📧 Backup Email

Your `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` will be used as the backup email for credential recovery, so that should work now too!

The authentication should now work correctly with your existing environment variable setup! 🎉
