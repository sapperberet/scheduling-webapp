EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail-address@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# Optional: Customize sender info
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Medical Scheduling System
# Email features have been removed from this application. EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS is no longer used.
```

**Setup Gmail App Password:**
1. Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
3. Generate an "App Password" for "Mail"
4. Use this 16-character password (not your regular Gmail password)

### Option 2: Microsoft Outlook/Hotmail

```env
# Outlook Configuration
EMAIL_SERVICE=outlook
EMAIL_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-password

# Optional: Customize sender info

# deprecated
```

### Option 3: SendGrid (Professional/Production)

```env
# SendGrid Configuration
EMAIL_SERVICE=sendgrid

## [Info] Troubleshooting

### Email Not Being Sent?

1. **Check Console Logs:**
   - Look for "ðŸ“§ Production email sent successfully!" messages
   - Error messages will show authentication or configuration issues

2. **Verify Environment Variables:**
   ```powershell
   # In PowerShell, check if variables are loaded:
   $env:EMAIL_SERVICE
   $env:EMAIL_USER
   ```

3. **Common Issues:**
   - **Gmail:** Make sure you're using an App Password, not your regular password
   - **Outlook:** Some accounts require "Less secure app access" to be enabled
   - **SendGrid:** Verify your sender email is authenticated
   - **SMTP:** Check firewall/port settings for custom SMTP servers

### Still Getting Preview URLs?

If you still see "Ethereal Email preview URLs" in the console, it means:
- Environment variables aren't loaded properly
- The email service is falling back to development mode
- Restart your development server after adding `.env.local`
