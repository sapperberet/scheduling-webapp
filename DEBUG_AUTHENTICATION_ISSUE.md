# [Info] Vercel Authentication Debug Guide

## Current Status Analysis

From your logs, I can see:

[Done] **Working:**
- Environment detection: `environment: 'serverless'` ‚úì
- Environment variable loading: `üåê Loading credentials from environment variables` ‚úì
- System is using Vercel environment variables instead of files ‚úì

[Error] **Issues:**
- Authentication failing: `providedUsername: 'changetheuser'` doesn't match your `ADMIN_USERNAME`
- No backup email configured: `hasEmail: false`

## [Maintenance] Quick Fix

### Issue 1: Wrong Username
Your user is trying to log in with `'changetheuser'`, but your `ADMIN_USERNAME` environment variable is set to something else.

**Solution Options:**

**Option A: Update Your Login (Recommended)**
- Check what username you set in Vercel environment variables
- Use that username to log in instead of `'changetheuser'`

**Option B: Update Environment Variable**
- If you want to use `'changetheuser'` as the username:
  1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
  2. Update `ADMIN_USERNAME` to `changetheuser`
  3. Redeploy your app

### Issue 2: No Backup Email
**To enable credential recovery:**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add `ADMIN_BACKUP_EMAIL` with your email address
3. Redeploy your app

## [Info] Check Your Current Environment Variables

Run this command to see what's currently set:

```bash
vercel env ls
```

You should see:
- `ADMIN_USERNAME` - This is what you need to use for login
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Your login password
- `ADMIN_BACKUP_EMAIL` - Should be set for recovery
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Should be a long random string
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Your Vercel app URL

## üêõ Debug Your Current Setup

To see what username is actually configured, you can temporarily add this log to your authentication system or check the Vercel environment variables in the dashboard.

**Current Login Attempt:**
- Trying to use: `'changetheuser'`
- Expected format: email address (e.g., `admin@yourcompany.com`)

## [Goal] Immediate Action Items

1. **Find Your Actual Username:**
   - Check Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Environment Variables ‚Üí `ADMIN_USERNAME`
   - Or update it to `changetheuser` if that's what you prefer

2. **Set Backup Email:**
   - Add `ADMIN_BACKUP_EMAIL` environment variable
   - Use your actual email address

3. **Test Login:**
   - Use the correct username from step 1
   - Use the password from your `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable

## üì± Quick Commands

```bash
# Check current environment variables
vercel env ls

# Update username to match what you're trying to use
vercel env add ADMIN_USERNAME production
# Enter: changetheuser

# Add backup email
vercel env add ADMIN_BACKUP_EMAIL production  
# Enter: your-email@domain.com

# Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

## [Done] Success Indicators

After fixing, you should see logs like:
```
[Info] Credential validation: {
  environment: 'serverless',
  providedUsername: 'changetheuser',
  isValid: true  ‚Üê This should be true
