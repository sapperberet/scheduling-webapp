# [Maintenance] Authentication Issue Resolved

## [Info] Problem Identified

You have conflicting environment variables:

**Username Variables:**
- `ADMIN_USERNAME` = `changetheuser` [Done]
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` = `admin@scheduling.com` 

**Password Variables:**
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` = `changethepass` (plaintext)
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` = `$2a$12$...` (bcrypt hash for "admin123")

## [Done] Fix Applied

I've updated the system to prioritize `ADMIN_USERNAME` over `ADMIN_EMAIL`, so now your login should be:

**Username:** `changetheuser`
**Password:** `changethepass` (since you have ADMIN_PASSWORD set)

## [Feature] Test Your Login

Try logging in with:
- **Username:** `changetheuser`  
- **Password:** `changethepass`

## [Note] Expected Logs

You should now see:
```
[Maintenance] Environment variable mapping: {
  username: 'changetheuser',
  hasPasswordHash: true,
  hasPlaintextPassword: true,
  hasBackupEmail: true
}
[Info] Credential validation (plaintext): {
  environment: 'serverless',
  providedUsername: 'changetheuser',
  usedBcrypt: false,
  isValid: true
}
```

## [Maintenance] Alternative: Use Bcrypt Hash

If you want to use the bcrypt hash instead, you can either:

**Option A:** Remove the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable so it uses the hash:
```bash
vercel env rm ADMIN_PASSWORD production
vercel --prod
```
Then use:
- Username: `changetheuser`
- Password: `admin123` (the original password that was hashed)

**Option B:** Create a new hash for "changethepass":
```bash
# In your project directory, run:
node -e "const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs'); console.log(bcrypt.hashSync('changethepass', 12));"
```
Then update `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` with the new hash and remove `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

## [Done] Current Setup

With the fix, your system will use:
- **Username:** `changetheuser` (from ADMIN_USERNAME)
- **Password:** `changethepass` (from ADMIN_PASSWORD, plaintext)
- **Backup Email:** `ahmedamromran2003@gmail.com` (from ADMIN_BACKUP_EMAIL)

This should work immediately after redeployment! [Done]
